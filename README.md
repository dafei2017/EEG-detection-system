# EEG-detection-system
A single channel Bluetooth transmission EEG signal detection system was built by using a new self-made graphene electrode combined with the TGAM module of Nerve Technology.In this system, a novel graphene electrode was fixed on the FP2 brain region of the headband for EEG acquisition.Then the signal is analyzed and processed by the TGAM module to form two kinds of values, "Attention" and "Meditation", which directly reflect the degree of driver's Attention.Finally, according to the numerical situation of "Attention" and "Meditation", the system provides corresponding reminders to drivers to reduce the occurrence of accidents.
